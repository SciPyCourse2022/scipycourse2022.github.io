# Description

Introduction to the [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
programming language, with a focus on practical tools and techniques for scientific data
analysis. Previous programming experience in a language such as
[Matlab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) or
[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is an asset, but not required.
Introduces various key Python libraries, and provides example problems. Students will be
encouraged to bring their own specific data analysis problems to class, for immediate
applicability to their work, culminating in a course project. Basic command line operations
and code version control with Git will also be covered. Students are expected to use their
own computer. A minimal level of attendance (9/12 classes) and participation is required, and
minimal homework exercises will be assigned.

This is course no. 19316 in the [official course listing](https://lsf.verwaltung.uni-muenchen.de/qisserver/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&publishid=919569&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfo&publishSubDir=veranstaltung).

# Tutorials

These are all free, and require no signup or login:

### Basic Python

* <http://introtopython.org> - is excellent!

* <http://learnpython.org> - has online editable and executable code

* <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html> - also has online
  editable and executable code, plus quizzes and videos

* The official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is also quite good, but doesn't really get started until [section 3](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)

### IPython and Jupyter

* [IPython](http://ipython.org) is an improved Python interactive terminal. This is
  what we will mostly spend our time in:
  <http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html>

* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) is IPython running in a web browser. It allows you to create
  "notebooks" that combine code, formatted text, and results:
  <http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/examples_index.html>

### Specific libraries

* Numpy is probably the most important data analysis library for Python:
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html>

* SciPy is another important library:
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial>

* Matplotlib is the most popular plotting library:
  <https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html>

* Pandas is another useful Python library for data analysis, built on top of numpy, that we'll
  introduce in the course. It has several tutorials:
  <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/>
